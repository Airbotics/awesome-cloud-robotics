> A curated list of awesome resources, tutorials and tools for cloud robotics.


Cloud robotics has meant a lot of things to a lot of people, and has gone by many aliases: _robotics cloud infra_, _RobOps_, _fleet management_, etc.  In this list we treat it as an umbrella term for applying cloud technologies to the field of robotics. 

Regardless of what you call it, robots often need to be connected to services in the cloud. These can include:
- Fleet health monitoring
- Offloading compute
- Over-the-air updates
- Data infrastructure and logging
- Map editing and annotation
- Task scheduling and assignment
- Cloud-based SLAM
- Configuration management
- Remote tele-operation
- ...and lots more.

The list provides awesome resources about each of them.
